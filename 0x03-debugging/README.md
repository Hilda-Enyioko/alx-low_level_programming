Task 0: That the function positive_or_negative() gives the correct output when given a case of 0

Task 1: Comment out the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop

Task 2: Fix the code in 2-largest_number.c so that it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case.

Task 3: make a new main file 3-main_b.c to try a case that is a leap year: 02/29/2000. Fix the ```print_remaining_days()``` function so that the output works correctly for all dates and all leap years.
