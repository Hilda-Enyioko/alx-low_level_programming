Learning about functions, header files, and nested loops in C.

Task 0: A program that prints _putchar, followed by a new line.

Task 1: Write a function that prints the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.
        Prototype: void print_alphabet(void);

Task 2: Write a function that prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.
        Prototype: void print_alphabet_x10(void);

Task 3: Write a function that checks for lowercase characters.
        Prototype: int _islower(int c);

Task 4: Write a function that checks for alphabetic characters.
        Prototype: int _isalpha(int c);

Task 5: Write a function that prints the sign of a number.
        Prototype: int print_sign(int n);
        Returns 1 and prints + if n is greater than zero
        Returns 0 and prints 0 if n is zero
        Returns -1 and prints - if n is less than zero

Task 6: Write a function that computes the absolute value of an integer.
        Prototype: int _abs(int);

Task 7: Write a function that prints the last digit of a number.
        Prototype: int print_last_digit(int);
        Returns the value of the last digit

Task 8: Write a function that prints every minute of the day of Jack Bauer, starting from 00:00 to 23:59.
        Prototype: void jack_bauer(void);
        
Task 9: Write a function that prints the 9 times table, starting with 0.
        Prototype: void times_table(void);

Task 10: Write a function that adds two integers and returns the result.
        Prototype: int add(int, int);

Task 11: Write a function that prints all natural numbers from n to 98, followed by a new line.
         Prototype: void print_to_98(int n);
         Numbers must be separated by a comma, followed by a space
         Numbers should be printed in order
         The first printed number should be the number passed to your function
         The last printed number should be 98
